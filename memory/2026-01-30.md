## 02:12 PST - Heartbeat Cycle

### System Status
- ✅ Autotrader running (PID 66542) but circuit breaker ACTIVE
  - 15 consecutive losses on weather markets
  - No pending positions (all settled)
  - Waiting for win to reset, but no trades happening = deadlock
- ✅ No alert files
- ✅ Sites healthy: 17/17 tests passing
- ✅ onde.la returns 200 OK

### Analysis
- Circuit breaker protecting capital after losing streak
- Recent losses were all on KXHIGHCHI (Chicago high temp) markets
- 5 losses in ~25 minutes on 2026-01-29 23:26-23:47
- Concentration history not being logged (file is empty)

### Tasks Added
- **[T762]** Autotrader: Circuit breaker time-based cooldown decay (P2)
  - Solve the deadlock: no win can happen if no trades are placed
  - Add time-based decay or manual reset option
- **[T763]** Trading: Weather market post-mortem analysis (P2)
  - Analyze the 2026-01-29 weather losing streak
  - Review edge calculation, forecast data freshness
- **[T764]** Trading: Fix concentration history logging (P2)
  - data/trading/concentration-history.jsonl is empty
  - Verify logging is called and handles empty portfolio

### Notes
- Autotrader is functioning correctly (circuit breaker = capital protection)
- Need to address deadlock scenario in T762
- Weather market strategy needs review in T763
