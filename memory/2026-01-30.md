## 04:45 PST - Heartbeat Work Cycle

### System Status
- ✅ Autotrader running (PID 66542)
- ✅ No alert files
- ⚠️ Circuit breaker was stuck in loop (15 losses → release → immediate re-trigger)

### Task Completed
- **[T762]** Autotrader: Circuit breaker time-based cooldown decay
  - **Problem fixed**: Circuit breaker was in a deadlock
    - 15 consecutive losses triggered the breaker
    - After 4h cooldown, it released
    - Immediately re-triggered because consecutive_losses still = 15
    - Repeat forever (no trades = no chance to win)
  - **Solution implemented**:
    - Added `get_effective_losses()` function with forgiveness + time decay
    - `forgiven_losses` state tracks losses forgiven after cooldown
    - Decay rate: -1 loss every 2 hours since last release
    - On cooldown release: forgive all current losses (prevents immediate re-trigger)
    - On win: clear forgiveness (fresh start)
    - Manual reset: `python3 kalshi-autotrader-v2.py --reset-circuit-breaker`
  - Applied fix to current state: 15 losses forgiven, trading resumed
  - Commit pending

- Modified: scripts/kalshi-autotrader-v2.py
