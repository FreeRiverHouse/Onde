# 2026-01-28 Session Notes

## Onde.la Deploy
- **Fixed deploy pipeline** - Cloudflare API token added to `.env`
- Token: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in project `.env`
- Script `./tools/tech-support/deploy-onde-la-prod.sh` now works
- **Issue:** Playwright not installed for automated tests - Claude Code fixing it
- **Workaround:** Direct wrangler deploy works with token set

## Moonlight House Upgrade 🎮
Major gameplay features added:
- 🏆 **Achievement system** (7 achievements: Explorer, First Meal, Sleepy Head, Socialite, Shopper, Wealthy, Healthy)
- 🌙 **Day/Night cycle** - visual overlay changes with real time
- 😊 **Mood system** - Happy, Sad, Sleepy, Hungry, Excited based on stats

## UI Components Added

- Autotrader continuing on 05:00 UTC series

## Key Learnings
- Wrangler needs `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` env var for non-interactive deploys
- My exec commands don't inherit shell env vars - need inline export
- Playwright Python module needed for test scripts (pip install playwright)

## GitHub Billing
- Deploy workflow failed due to billing/spending limit issue
- User needs to check: https://github.com/settings/billing
