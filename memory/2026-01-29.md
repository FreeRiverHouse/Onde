### T087 Completed: Multi-timeframe Momentum Integration
- **Problem**: Momentum tracking code existed but was NEVER USED in find_opportunities()
- **Solution**:
  1. `get_btc_ohlc()` now fetches 7-day OHLC (valid CoinGecko param)
  2. `run_cycle()` calculates momentum before scanning markets
  3. `find_opportunities()` now accepts momentum parameter
  4. Probabilities adjusted via `adjust_probability_with_momentum()`
  5. Skip trades that conflict with strong momentum trends
  6. 2% edge bonus for momentum-aligned trades
  7. Momentum logged with each trade for analysis
- **Fix**: CoinGecko OHLC only accepts specific days (1,7,14,30...), changed from days=2 to days=7

### New Tasks Added
- T232: Add momentum analysis to weekly trading report
- T233: Add Fear & Greed index to trade logs
- T234: Implement trailing stop-loss

### Autotrader Status
- Running: PID 2997
- Balance: $11.13 cash, $5.29 portfolio
- 7 open positions
