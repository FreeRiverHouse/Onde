### Status Check
- Autotrader: ✅ Running (PID 66542)

### Task Completed: [T669] VR/XR Planning
- Created comprehensive planning doc: `apps/reader-app/docs/VR-XR-PLANNING.md`
- Recommended React-Three-Fiber + WebXR for MVP (3 weeks)
- Defined environments: Library, Mountain cabin, Floating clouds
- Key tech: troika-three-text for crisp text rendering
- Platforms: Quest 3 (primary), Vision Pro (future)

### New Tasks Added
1. **[T701]** R3F prototype with floating text - P2
2. **[T702]** Cozy library environment - P3
3. **[T703]** EPUB text extraction for VR - P2

### Observations
- Many high-priority tasks (T477, T426) require manual intervention from Mattia
- SE-Bot chain blocked on BlackHole audio driver install (needs sudo)
- Reader App VR path is now well-defined and can proceed

### Next Actions
- T701 when ready to start VR development
- Wait for Mattia on manual tasks (BlackHole, CF API token)
