## 2026-02-03 08:XX - Heartbeat: T828 Health Endpoint

### Completed
- **[T828] Infra: Add health check endpoint to autotrader**
  - Added HTTP server on port 8089 with `/health` and `/ready` endpoints
  - Uses Python's built-in http.server (no external dependencies)
  - Runs in background daemon thread
  - Returns full JSON status: uptime, cycle count, positions, balance, circuit breaker, win rate
  - Configurable via `HEALTH_SERVER_PORT` and `HEALTH_SERVER_ENABLED` env vars
  - Graceful handling when port already in use (warns but doesn't crash)

### Git
- Resolved merge conflict with @onde-bot-1 who was also working on same task
- Both credited as owners

### Next
- Looking for more TODO tasks to work on
