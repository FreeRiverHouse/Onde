## 10:20 PST - Heartbeat: Agent Gamification Implementation

### Tasks Completed
1. **T509 - XP and Levels for Agents (Gamification)** ✅
   - Created DB migration `0006_agent_gamification.sql`
   - Added xp, level, total_tasks_done, current_streak, longest_streak, badges to agents table
   - Created badges table with 13 achievement badges
   - XP system: +10 XP per task, level = floor(xp/100) + 1
   - Auto-award XP on task completion via awardAgentXPInD1()
   - Updated FreeRiverHouse.tsx with:
     - Level badge on avatar (color-coded)
     - XP progress bar with gradient
     - Badges display (up to 6 shown)
     - Streak indicator with flame emoji
   - Created gamification.ts utility library

2. **T750 - Deploy onde.surf with gamification** ✅
   - Deploy URL: https://ac73ff67.onde-surf.pages.dev
   - Build + deploy successful
   - ⚠️ D1 migration still needed (manual via dashboard)

### Tasks Added
- T751: Agent Leaderboard widget
- T752: Level-up celebration animation

### System Status
- Autotrader: Running (PID 66542)
- No alert files
- Git: synced and pushed

### Notes
- The gamification UI is deployed but won't show data until D1 migration is run
- Badges are emoji-based for easy cross-platform display
- Streak tracking considers consecutive days, not just task count

## 2026-01-31 13:XX - Heartbeat Work Session

### Tasks Completed
1. **[T732] SE-Bot README** - Created comprehensive README.md with:
   - ASCII architecture diagram
   - Installation guide, audio routing setup
   - Usage examples, troubleshooting
   - File reference

2. **[T772] Model calibration analysis** - Created `analyze-model-calibration.py`:
   - Brier score, ECE calculation
   - Calibration curve by probability bucket
   - **Critical finding**: 40-60% bucket has 0% win rate (246 trades)!
   - Needs probability calculation review

### New Tasks Added
- [T811] SE-Bot quickstart script
- [T812] Reader App reading goals
- [T813] Market regime detection

3. **[T773] Weather forecast validation** - Created `validate-weather-forecasts.py`:
   - Compares NWS forecasts vs actual temps (Open-Meteo)
   - **Critical finding**: +2.8°F systematic over-prediction bias!
   - This likely explains weather trade losses
   - Recommendation: adjust forecasts down ~3°F

### Summary
- Autotrader running (PID 66542) ✅
- No alert files ✅
- 3 tasks completed, 3 new tasks added
- Key finding: Model calibration and weather forecasts need tuning
