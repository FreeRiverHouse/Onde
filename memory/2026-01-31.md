   - Added xp, level, total_tasks_done, current_streak, longest_streak, badges to agents table
   - Created badges table with 13 achievement badges
   - XP system: +10 XP per task, level = floor(xp/100) + 1
   - Auto-award XP on task completion via awardAgentXPInD1()
   - Updated FreeRiverHouse.tsx with:
     - Level badge on avatar (color-coded)
     - XP progress bar with gradient
     - Badges display (up to 6 shown)
     - Streak indicator with flame emoji
   - Created gamification.ts utility library

2. **T750 - Deploy onde.surf with gamification** ✅
   - Deploy URL: https://ac73ff67.onde-surf.pages.dev
   - Build + deploy successful
   - ⚠️ D1 migration still needed (manual via dashboard)

### Tasks Added

- T752: Level-up celebration animation

### System Status
- Autotrader: Running (PID 66542)
- No alert files
- Git: synced and pushed

- Badges are emoji-based for easy cross-platform display
- Streak tracking considers consecutive days, not just task count
