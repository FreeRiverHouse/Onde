## Trade #1: BTC $88,750+ Tomorrow

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Bitcoin price tomorrow at 5pm EST |
| **Strike** | $88,750 or above |
| **Direction** | YES |
| **Contracts** | 1 |
| **Entry Price** | 61¢ |
| **Cost (incl fee)** | $0.61 |
| **Potential Payout** | $1.00 |
| **Max Profit** | +$0.39 (+64% ROI) |
| **Expiry** | Jan 28, 2026 @ 5:00pm EST |
| **Status** | OPEN |

**Reasoning:**
- BTC at entry: ~$89,047
- Strike buffer: $297 (only -0.33% move needed to lose)
- Kalshi implied prob: 56-59%
- My estimated prob: ~68-70% (very unlikely BTC drops 0.33% in 24h without catalyst)
- Estimated edge: ~10-12%
- Kelly fraction: ~27% → used ~7.7% bankroll

## Trade #2: ETH $2,980+ Tomorrow

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Ethereum price tomorrow at 5pm EST |
| **Strike** | $2,980 or above |
| **Direction** | YES |
| **Contracts** | 1 |
| **Entry Price** | 70¢ |

| **Max Profit** | +$0.30 (+43% ROI) |
| **Expiry** | Jan 28, 2026 @ 5:00pm EST |

**Reasoning:**
- ETH at entry: ~$3,009
- Strike buffer: $29 (only -0.97% move needed to lose)
- Kalshi implied prob: 68%
- My estimated prob: ~72-75% (ETH above $2,980 is a wide buffer in stable market)
- Estimated edge: ~4-7%
- Kelly fraction: ~18% → used ~8.9% bankroll

## Risk Analysis

**Correlation Risk:** Both trades are correlated (crypto directional). A market-wide crypto dump would hit both. However:
- Both require only small buffers (0.33% and 0.97%)
- Would need significant negative catalyst to breach both
- Position sizes are micro ($0.61 + $0.70 = $1.31 total)

**Expected Value:**
- Trade 1: EV = 0.68 × $1.00 - $0.61 = +$0.07
- Trade 2: EV = 0.73 × $1.00 - $0.70 = +$0.03
- Combined EV: +$0.10 on $1.31 deployed = +7.6% expected return

## Notes for Next Session
- Monitor BTC and ETH price action
- Check for any macro catalysts (Fed, earnings, geopolitical)
- Trades resolve Jan 28 @ 5pm EST
- Consider SOL markets for Friday expiry if prices favorable
