## Chapter One: A Strange New Friend

On her seventh birthday, Sofia found a cardboard box with her name on it.

Inside was something she had never seen before.

Sofia nodded. She always wanted to know how things worked.

AIKO's eyes glowed thoughtfully.

## Chapter Eight: The Future We Build Together

On the last day of summer, Sofia sat with AIKO in the backyard. The sun was setting, painting the sky orange and pink.

"What will the future be like?" she asked.

Sofia waited.

Sofia picked a blade of grass and twirled it. "So we're like... a team?"

Sofia smiled at the sunset. "I think the future is going to be pretty interesting."
