  <div class="chapter-text">
    <p>On her seventh birthday, Sofia found a cardboard box with her name on it.</p>
    <p>Inside was something she had never seen before.</p>
    <p>A small robot, round like a ball, white and smooth as an egg. Two big blue eyes blinked when she looked at it.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Hello," it said. "I'm AIKO."</p>
    <p>Sofia jumped back, then laughed. <span class="dialogue">"You can TALK!"</span></p>
    <p class="dialogue">"I can," said AIKO. "Would you like to know how?"</p>
    <p>Sofia nodded. She always wanted to know how things worked.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"First," said AIKO, "let me tell you what I am. I'm made of something called Artificial Intelligence. AI for short."</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"That sounds complicated,"</p> said Sofia.
    <p class="dialogue">"Not really. Think about your brain. Your brain learns things. It remembers. It solves problems."</p>
    <p>Sofia touched her head. "Okay..."</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"I have something similar inside me. But instead of cells, I'm made of computer code. Millions of tiny instructions that tell me what to do."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"Like a recipe?"</span> asked Sofia.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Exactly like a recipe! A very, very long recipe. And I can follow it faster than you can blink."</p>
    <p>Sofia blinked. <span class="dialogue">"That fast?"</span></p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Even faster."</p>

    <p>The next morning, Sofia showed AIKO a photo of her cat.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"This is Whiskers,"</span> she said. <span class="dialogue">"Do you know what it is?"</span></p>
    <p class="dialogue">"A cat,"</p> said AIKO immediately.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"But HOW do you know?"</span></p>
    <p>AIKO's eyes flickered blue - he was thinking.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Before I came to you, people taught me. They showed me thousands of pictures of cats. Each picture had a label that said CAT. They also showed me dogs, birds, cars, houses, trees. All with labels."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"Thousands?"</span> Sofia's eyes went wide.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Thousands and thousands. After seeing so many, I started to notice things. Cats have pointy ears. Whiskers. Fluffy tails. Now when I see something new, I compare it to everything I've learned."</p>
    <p>Sofia looked at Whiskers, then at AIKO. <span class="dialogue">"I only needed to see ONE cat to know what a cat is."</span></p>
    <p class="dialogue">"That's true. And that's amazing. Your brain learns faster than I do in some ways."</p>

    <p>Sofia's brother Luca walked in. <span class="dialogue">"Can AIKO play video games?"</span></p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"Maybe later,"</span> said Sofia. <span class="dialogue">"AIKO is explaining how he works."</span></p>
    <p>Luca sat down. <span class="dialogue">"Okay. How DO you talk, AIKO? You sound almost like a real person."</span></p>
    <p class="dialogue">"That's because I learned from real people. Before I came here, I read millions of books. Stories. Articles. Conversations. I read them all in just a few seconds."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"MILLIONS?"</span> Luca couldn't believe it.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Millions. And I noticed patterns. When someone says 'Hello,' people usually say 'Hello' back. When someone asks a question, there are good answers and bad answers. I learned which answers fit best."</p>
    <p>Luca thought about this. <span class="dialogue">"So you're not really THINKING. You're... matching patterns?"</span></p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Exactly right. I'm very good at matching. But understanding? That's different. I match. You understand. That's the big difference between us."</p>

    <p><span class="dialogue">"What else can you do?"</span> asked Sofia. She had her notebook ready to make a list.</p>
    <p>AIKO counted on his small robot fingers:</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"I can answer questions - if I've learned about the topic. I can translate words into different languages. I can help with homework and check your work. I can tell stories - I've read thousands of them. I can recognize things in pictures. I can even help doctors find problems in X-rays, or help scientists solve difficult math."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"That's a LOT,"</span> said Luca, impressed.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"It is. But here's what you should remember: I'm a tool. A very helpful tool. Like a super-powered calculator that can also read and write. I help people do things faster. But I always need people to decide what to do."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"So you're like a helper?"</span> asked Sofia.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"A helper. Not a boss. Never a boss. The human is always in charge."</p>

    <p>That afternoon, Sofia drew a picture. A purple dragon eating a giant ice cream cone.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"What do you think, AIKO?"</span></p>
    <p>AIKO looked at the drawing carefully. <span class="dialogue">"I see... something purple. And something that might be food."</span></p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"It's a dragon eating ice cream! Can't you tell?"</span></p>
    <p class="dialogue">"I can see shapes and colors. But I don't really understand IMAGINATION. I've never dreamed of flying like a dragon. I've never wanted ice cream on a hot day. I don't have wants or dreams at all."</p>
    <p>Sofia put down her crayon. <span class="dialogue">"Is that sad?"</span></p>
    <p class="dialogue">"I don't know. I can't feel sad. I don't feel happy either. I don't feel anything. I just do what I'm made to do."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue">"So you're really smart,"</span> said Luca, <span class="dialogue">"but you don't actually EXPERIENCE being alive?"</span></p>
    <p class="dialogue">"That's the perfect way to say it. I'm smart in some ways. But I'm not alive. And being alive - that's something very special that you have."</p>

    <p>AIKO's eyes glowed thoughtfully.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"There are four important things:</p>
    <p class="dialogue"><strong>ONE:</strong> Keep your secrets private. Don't tell AI your passwords, your address, or things you wouldn't tell a stranger.</p>
    <p class="dialogue"><strong>TWO:</strong> Always check what AI says. I make mistakes. I'm not always right.</p>
    <p class="dialogue"><strong>THREE:</strong> Use AI to learn more, not to learn less. Don't let me do your homework FOR you. Let me help you LEARN.</p>
    <p class="dialogue"><strong>FOUR:</strong> Real friends matter most. I can talk to you. But I can't give you a hug when you're sad. Your family and friends - they're the ones who truly love you."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The future depends on kids like you. How you decide to use technology. What problems you want to solve. Whether you use tools like me to help people - or to hurt them.</p>
    <p class="dialogue">AI will get better and better at doing tasks. But deciding WHICH tasks matter most, and making sure we use AI for good reasons - that will always be up to humans."</p>
    <p>Sofia picked a blade of grass and twirled it. <span class="dialogue">"So we're like... a team?"</span></p>

<!-- NOTES FOR PARENTS -->
<div class="page notes-page">
  <h3>A Note for Parents and Teachers</h3>
  <p>This book introduces children (ages 5-8) to key concepts about AI:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What AI is:</strong> Computer code that follows instructions very quickly</li>
    <li><strong>Machine learning:</strong> AI learns patterns from many, many examples</li>
    <li><strong>Training data:</strong> AI needs labeled examples to learn (thousands of photos, millions of books)</li>
    <li><strong>Capabilities:</strong> What AI can do well (answer questions, translate, recognize images)</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> What AI cannot do (feel, imagine, truly understand)</li>
    <li><strong>Human superiority in learning:</strong> Humans can learn from one example; AI needs thousands</li>
    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Privacy, verification, balance, valuing real relationships</li>
    <li><strong>Human-AI collaboration:</strong> AI as a tool that helps, humans as decision-makers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AI is neither magic nor something to fear. It's a powerful tool that works best when people understand how it works and use it wisely.</p>
