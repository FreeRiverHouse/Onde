# Introduction: What is Code Surfing?

There's a moment every developer knows. You're staring at a blank file, cursor blinking, and you need to build something. Maybe it's a simple script. Maybe it's a whole application. Either way, you're about to type a lot of code.

Or are you?

## The Wave Has Changed

In 2024, something shifted. AI coding assistants went from "interesting toy" to "I can't imagine working without this." By 2025, the best developers weren't the ones who typed the fastest—they were the ones who could *direct* AI to build what they imagined.

We call this **Code Surfing**.

Like a surfer riding a wave, you're not fighting the water. You're working *with* it. The AI is the wave—powerful, fast, sometimes unpredictable. Your job is to stay balanced, point in the right direction, and enjoy the ride.

## What This Book Is (And Isn't)

This is not a book about prompting tricks. It's not a collection of ChatGPT hacks. It's not theory.

This is a practical guide based on real projects. Every technique in this book comes from actual work:

- A Telegram bot built in an afternoon
- A children's book publishing pipeline
- A dashboard that went from idea to deployed in hours
- Multi-agent workflows that coordinate like a small team

I didn't read about these techniques. I *did* them. And now I'm going to show you how.

## Who Should Read This

- **Developers** who want to 10x their output
- **Founders** who want to build MVPs without a team
- **Creators** who have ideas but think "I can't code"
- **Anyone** curious about how AI is changing software

If you can describe what you want in plain English, you can code surf.

## The Tools

Throughout this book, we'll use:

- **Claude** (via Claude Code CLI) - our primary AI assistant
- **Grok** - for image generation and alternative perspectives
- **Browser automation** - for when APIs don't exist
- **Standard tools** - Node.js, Python, Git, the usual suspects

You don't need all of these to start. You just need one AI and an idea.

## How to Read This Book

Each chapter builds on the last, but you can skip around. If you're impatient (good—that's the code surfing spirit), jump to Chapter 3 and build something immediately. Come back to the fundamentals when you get stuck.

The best way to learn is to do. So open your terminal, fire up your AI assistant, and let's catch some waves.
