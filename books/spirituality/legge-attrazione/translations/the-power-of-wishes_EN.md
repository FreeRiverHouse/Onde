*A book for little dreamers*

## Chapter 1: The Boy Who Dreamed

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Bambino di 6 anni con capelli castani seduto sul davanzale, guarda il cielo stellato, cameretta accogliente con luce dorata della lampada, peluche sul letto]

Leo was six years old, with brown hair and a heart full of dreams.

Every evening, when the sky turned dark blue and the stars began to sparkle, he would sit by the window and think.

"Mommy," he said one evening, as the moon peeked out from behind the clouds, "how do you make wishes come true?"

His mom came in with soft footsteps, sat beside him, and stroked his hair.

"Would you like me to tell you a secret?"

## Chapter 2: The Secret of Thoughts

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Mamma e figlio seduti insieme sul letto, mani intrecciate, coperta morbida color crema, luce calda della lampada sul comodino]

"Your thoughts," said Mom softly, "are like little seeds."

"Seeds?" Leo tilted his head.

"Yes. Every thought is a tiny seed. If you think beautiful things, colorful flowers will grow. If you think sad things, weeds will grow."

Leo looked at his hands, turning them slowly.

"So I have to think beautiful things?"

"Exactly. But it's not enough to just think them." Mom took his hands and placed them on his chest. "You have to feel them here. The heart is the garden where seeds truly grow."

## Chapter 3: The Wishing Game

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Leo con occhi chiusi e sorriso sereno, intorno a lui nuvole morbide con immagini sfumate - un cagnolino marrone, una bicicletta rossa, bambini che ridono insieme]

Mom taught him a special game.

"Close your eyes. Breathe slowly. Think of something you really wish for."

Leo closed his eyes.

"Are you there?" Mom whispered.

"Yes! I see a puppy!"

"Now touch it. What does its fur feel like?"

"Super soft!"

"Can you feel its little heart beating? Is it licking your hand?"

"Yes!" Leo laughed. "It tickles!"

"And how do you feel?"

"Happy! So happy!"

When he opened his eyes, his smile lit up the room.

## Chapter 4: The Magic Word

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Leo in un prato verde con braccia aperte al cielo, raggi di sole dorati che lo avvolgono, farfalle bianche intorno]

"There's a magic word," said Mom the next day. "A word that works like a key."

"Please?"

"That one is polite. But there's one more powerful."

Mom leaned toward him.

"Thank you."

"Thank you?"

"When you say thank you for the beautiful things you already have, your heart opens. And when it's open, more beautiful things can come in."

From that day on, Leo started saying thank you for everything.

Thank you for the sun. Thank you for breakfast. Thank you for Mom's kisses. Thank you for being Leo.

## Chapter 5: The Dream Notebook

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Leo seduto al tavolino, quaderno blu con stelline dorate aperto, matite colorate sparse, espressione concentrata]

For his birthday, Mom gave him a special notebook: a midnight blue cover, full of golden stars.

"This is your Dream Notebook. Every day, draw something beautiful that you wish for."

Leo hugged it to his chest.

In the following days, he filled it with drawings: a puppy with floppy ears, a treehouse, a trip to the beach.

Every evening he would flip through it, smiling.

He didn't know yet that those drawings were maps. Maps to places he would truly visit.

## Chapter 6: The Special Day

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Papà sulla porta con scatola bucherellata, Leo che corre verso di lui con occhi spalancati, luce dorata del tardo pomeriggio dalla finestra]

Weeks passed. Then months.

Leo kept thinking about the puppy, feeling its soft fur, saying thank you.

One autumn afternoon, Dad came home with a box.

A box that was moving.

"Leo, come here."

His heart was beating fast. He approached slowly.

Dad opened it.

Two little brown eyes, shiny like chestnuts, looked at him. A little tail started wagging.

"My wish!" Leo took the puppy in his arms. "It came true!"

## Chapter 7: How It Works

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Leo che corre in un parco autunnale con foglie dorate, il cagnolino che saltella accanto a lui, luce calda del tramonto]

Leo named the puppy Star.

One Sunday at the park he asked: "Mom, how did the wish become real?"

Mom looked at the clouds.

"When you wish with all your heart, your heart sends a signal. Like a light. The world listens, in its own way."

"Can I wish for anything?"

"Anything that makes you feel happy and good. Do you know which wishes are the most beautiful?"

"Which ones?"

"The ones that make others happy too."

## Chapter 8: The Shared Secret

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Leo che sussurra all'orecchio di un amico in giardino, entrambi sorridono, fiori di campo intorno]

Leo grew, and the secret kept working.

Not all wishes arrived right away. Some took time. Others came in unexpected ways, always perfect.

And he understood something important: the greatest magic was sharing it.

So he started telling the secret. To his friend Thomas. To his cousin Sophie. To children who seemed sad.

"Close your eyes. Think of something beautiful. Feel it in your heart. Say thank you."

## Chapter 9: Your Turn

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Un bambino seduto su un davanzale a guardare le stelle, atmosfera magica, potrebbe essere chiunque]

And now it's your turn.

Close your eyes.

Breathe slowly.

Think of something beautiful. Don't just look at it: touch it, feel it.

How does it make you feel?

Say thank you. Thank you because your heart knows how to dream.

Then wait. With patience. With trust.

The most beautiful wishes are born from the heart.

And the heart always knows the way.

## Chapter 10: The Promise of the Stars

[ILLUSTRAZIONE: Cielo notturno con stelle brillanti attraverso finestra aperta, stella cadente, atmosfera di magia e possibilità infinite]

Leo is ten years old now.

Star sleeps at the foot of his bed.

But every evening, before closing his eyes, he still looks at the stars.

They're no longer just distant lights.

They are promises.

Promises that dreams, the real ones, the ones felt with the heart...

...can become reality.

You just have to believe.

With all your heart.

*The End*

*To all the children who never stop dreaming.*
*And to the adults who have forgotten how.*
