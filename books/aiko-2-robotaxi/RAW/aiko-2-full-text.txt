DEDICATION

For every child who looks out the car window
and wonders:
"What if the car could drive itself?"

The future is closer than you think.

---

Inspired by an idea from Neri:

"Let your curiosity lead you to explore more and more,
and build whatever your mind dreams up."

Keep dreaming. Keep building.

CHAPTER ONE
A Special Trip

[ILLUSTRATION: Sofia and Mom standing outside their house on a sunny morning. Sofia holds AIKO in her arms. A sleek white car with no visible driver is pulling up to the curb. Sofia's eyes are wide with curiosity.]

It was a sunny Saturday morning.
Mom had a surprise for Sofia.

"Today, we're going to Grandma's house," said Mom.
"But we're not taking our car."

Sofia looked confused. "Then how will we get there?"

Mom smiled and pointed at her phone.
"I called a special taxi. Look!"

A white car pulled up in front of their house.
It was smooth and quiet.
And when Sofia looked through the window...

"Mom! There's no one driving!"

AIKO's blue eyes blinked with excitement.
"Sofia, this is a ROBOTAXI.
A car that drives itself.
Using Artificial Intelligence - just like me!"

CHAPTER TWO
A Car with Robot Eyes

[ILLUSTRATION: Close-up of the robotaxi showing its sensors - cameras on all sides like eyes, a spinning LiDAR on the roof like a small hat, and radar sensors on the bumpers. Sofia and AIKO examine them curiously while Mom opens the door.]

Before getting in, Sofia walked around the car.
She noticed strange things on it.

"What are all these bumps and cameras?" she asked.

AIKO floated closer to explain.

"These are the car's EYES.
See these cameras? There are eight of them!
They can see in every direction at once.
You only have two eyes looking forward.
This car can see all around - even behind!"

Sofia pointed at a small spinning thing on the roof.
"What about that?"

"That's called LiDAR," said AIKO.
"It shoots invisible laser beams in all directions.
The beams bounce back from everything nearby -
trees, people, other cars, even a tiny cat crossing the street.
It creates a 3D map of everything around the car.
Sixty times every second!"

"Wow," whispered Sofia. "It sees MORE than we do."

"In some ways, yes. But it doesn't UNDERSTAND
what it sees the way you do.
It just collects information."

═══════════════════════════════════════

CHAPTER THREE
The Brain Inside

[ILLUSTRATION: Inside the robotaxi. Sofia and Mom sit in comfortable back seats. No steering wheel visible up front. Screens show a map and a view of the road. AIKO sits between them, explaining. The interior is cozy and futuristic.]

They climbed inside.
The car was cozy, with soft seats and big windows.

"Welcome aboard," said a friendly voice.
"I will take you to Grandma's house safely."

Sofia looked around. "Where's the steering wheel?"

"There isn't one," said Mom. "This car doesn't need it."

AIKO explained: "The car has a computer brain.
It takes all the information from the cameras and LiDAR,
and it thinks: What should I do next?"

"But how does it KNOW what to do?" asked Sofia.

"Remember how I learned to see cats
by looking at thousands of pictures?"

Sofia nodded.

"This car learned the same way.
It practiced driving millions and millions of times.
It learned what to do when a light turns red.
What to do when someone crosses the street.
What to do when another car gets too close.
It learned from every situation it could imagine."

The car started moving smoothly.
Sofia didn't even feel it start.

═══════════════════════════════════════

CHAPTER FOUR
Seeing the Invisible

[ILLUSTRATION: Split view - on one side, what Sofia sees through the window (a normal street with cars, trees, people). On the other side, what the robotaxi "sees" - the same scene but with colored boxes around every object, dotted lines showing predicted paths of moving things, road lines highlighted in bright colors.]

As they drove, a screen in front showed something magical.

It showed the street - but different.
Every car had a colored box around it.
Every person had a glowing outline.
Dotted lines showed where things were moving.

"What is this?" asked Sofia.

"This is how the car SEES the world," said AIKO.
"It doesn't see colors and shapes like you do.
It sees objects and movements.
Every car is a box with a speed and direction.
Every person is a point that might move.
The car is always predicting: What will happen next?"

Mom pointed at a cyclist on the side of the road.
On the screen, a dotted line showed where the cyclist might go.

"See? The car is already planning what to do
if the cyclist moves into the road."

"It thinks ahead!" said Sofia.

"Always," said AIKO. "Many times per second.
It asks: What could go wrong?
And it has a plan for everything."

CHAPTER FIVE
Safety First

[ILLUSTRATION: The robotaxi stopped at a crosswalk. A group of children is crossing, one of them drops a ball that rolls toward the street. The car stays completely still, its sensors glowing gently. Sofia watches through the window, feeling safe.]

Suddenly, the car slowed down and stopped.

"Why did we stop?" asked Sofia.

She looked out the window.
A group of children was crossing the street.
One of them dropped a ball, and it rolled toward the road.

The car stayed completely still.
It waited until every child was safely across.
Then it waited three more seconds - just to be sure.

"The car is very careful," said Mom.

AIKO nodded. "The most important rule for a robotaxi is:
NEVER hurt anyone.
If there's even a tiny chance something could be dangerous,
the car will stop and wait.
It's not in a hurry. Safety always comes first."

"But what if something breaks?" asked Sofia.
"What if a camera stops working?"

"Good question! The car has BACKUP systems.
If one camera fails, there are seven more.
If the main computer has a problem,
a second computer takes over immediately.
And if something really goes wrong,
the car will safely pull over and stop."

Sofia felt safe.
Safer than she expected.

CHAPTER SIX
No Driver, But Many Helpers

[ILLUSTRATION: A split scene showing different people who help the robotaxi work - engineers at computers programming the AI, map makers updating road information, a remote operator watching screens with many robotaxis, mechanics checking a car. All connected by glowing lines to the robotaxi Sofia is in.]

"So the car drives itself," said Sofia.
"But who MADE it so smart?"

"Thousands of people," said AIKO.

"Really?"

"Really. Engineers wrote the code that lets the car think.
Artists designed the maps it follows.
Safety experts tested it millions of times.
Mechanics keep every car in perfect condition.
And somewhere, right now, people are watching
to make sure all the robotaxis are doing okay."

Mom added: "Even though there's no driver in this car,
humans are still in charge.
The people who built it, who test it, who watch over it."

"So it's like... teamwork?" asked Sofia.

"The biggest teamwork ever," said AIKO.
"Humans and AI, working together.
The AI does the driving.
The humans make sure it drives WELL."

CHAPTER SEVEN
Dreaming of Tomorrow

[ILLUSTRATION: Sofia looking out the window, imagining the future - flying taxis in the sky, delivery robots on sidewalks, cities with clean air and lots of trees, happy people walking because there are fewer cars. A dreamy, hopeful atmosphere with soft golden light.]

The ride was almost over.
Sofia could see Grandma's neighborhood.

"AIKO," she said, "what will the future be like?
Will ALL cars drive themselves?"

"Maybe," said AIKO. "Someday.
Imagine a world where no one crashes because of mistakes.
Where old people and kids can travel anywhere, safely.
Where cars talk to each other so there are no traffic jams.
Where cities have more parks because we need fewer parking lots."

"That sounds amazing," said Sofia.

"It could be. But it's up to humans to decide.
Technology can help.
But people must choose to use it wisely.
To share it fairly.
To make sure it helps everyone, not just a few."

Sofia thought about this.
"I want to help build that future."

AIKO's eyes glowed warmly.
"I know you will, Sofia.
That's what makes humans so special.
You don't just accept the world as it is.
You dream of how it could be better."

═══════════════════════════════════════

CHAPTER EIGHT
Arriving Safely

[ILLUSTRATION: The robotaxi stopped in front of Grandma's house. Grandma waves from the porch. Sofia hugs Mom, holding AIKO. The car's lights blink a friendly goodbye. Warm, happy, cozy scene with afternoon sunlight.]

The car stopped gently in front of Grandma's house.

"You have arrived," said the friendly voice.
"Thank you for riding with us. Have a wonderful day!"

Grandma was already waving from the porch.

Sofia stepped out and looked back at the robotaxi.
"Thank you, car!"

The car's lights blinked once - almost like a wink.
Then it drove away quietly to pick up someone else.

"So," said Mom, "what did you think?"

Sofia smiled her biggest smile.
"I think the future is already here.
And it's pretty amazing."

She looked at AIKO.
"But you know what's even more amazing?"

"What?" asked AIKO.

"That people like us get to decide what comes next.
We're not just passengers.
We're the ones who will build tomorrow."

AIKO blinked happily.
"Together."

"Together," Sofia agreed.

And they went inside to tell Grandma
all about their incredible adventure.
