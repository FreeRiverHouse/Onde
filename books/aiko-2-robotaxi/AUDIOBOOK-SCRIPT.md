[PAUSA: 0.5 sec]

"The car is very careful," said Mom.

[PAUSA: 0.5 sec]

[TONO: AIKO - serio, importante]
AIKO nodded. "The most important rule for a robotaxi is:
[ENFASI] NEVER hurt anyone.
If there's even a [ENFASI] tiny chance something could be dangerous,
the car will stop and wait.
It's not in a hurry. Safety [ENFASI] always comes first."

[PAUSA: 0.5 sec]

[TONO: Sofia - pensieroso]
"But what if something [ENFASI] breaks?" asked Sofia.
"What if a camera stops working?"

[PAUSA: 0.5 sec]

"Good question! The car has [ENFASI] BACKUP systems.
If one camera fails, there are seven more.
If the main computer has a problem,
a second computer takes over immediately.
And if something [ENFASI] really goes wrong,
the car will safely pull over and stop."

[PAUSA: 0.3 sec]

[TONO: Sofia - sorpresa]

[TONO: Sofia - sognante]
"That sounds [ENFASI] amazing," said Sofia.

[PAUSA: 0.5 sec]

[TONO: AIKO - serio ma pieno di speranza]
"It could be. But it's up to [ENFASI] humans to decide.
Technology can help.
But people must choose to use it [ENFASI] wisely.
To share it fairly.
To make sure it helps [ENFASI] everyone, not just a few."

[PAUSA: 0.5 sec]

*(Opzionale - può essere omessa nella versione breve)*

[TONO: Professionale ma caldo]

A Note for Parents and Teachers.

[PAUSA: 1 sec]

This book introduces children ages five to eight to autonomous vehicles and robotaxis.

Key concepts covered:
Sensors... how self-driving cars "see" using cameras, LiDAR, and radar.
AI processing... how the car makes decisions based on data.
Pattern recognition... cars learn from millions of driving examples.
Safety systems... redundancy, backup systems, and cautious behavior.
Human oversight... engineers, operators, and testers behind the technology.
Predictions... how AI anticipates what might happen next.
And future possibilities... safer roads, accessibility, and environmental benefits.

[PAUSA: 0.5 sec]

Important messages:
AI is a tool created and supervised by humans.
Safety is the top priority in autonomous systems.
Technology should help everyone, not just a few.
And children can be part of building a better future.

[PAUSA: 1 sec]

Self-driving cars are becoming part of our world.
Understanding how they work helps children feel comfortable with new technology...
