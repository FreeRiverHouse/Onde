### Introduction

This is the story of Tommy.

Tommy is six years old. He has brown hair, always a bit messy. And he never sits still.

He runs. He jumps. He laughs. He asks questions.

One day, Tommy finds something amazing. Something he has always had. But he never noticed it before.

His breath.

This is the story of how Tommy learns to use his magic breath. And how you can learn too.

Are you ready? Good.

Take a big breath.

Here we go.

### Chapter 1 - The Puff of Wind

It was a windy day.

Tommy was in the garden. His hair flew everywhere. The leaves were doing somersaults.

"Mummy, the wind is so strong!" he shouted.

Mummy smiled. "You know what? You have wind inside you too."

"Inside where?"

"Inside you. It's called your breath."

Tommy thought for a moment. Then he blew hard. FFFFFFF! The leaves moved.

"See?" said Mummy. "Your breath is like the wind. It can be strong, like a storm. Or gentle, like a breeze."

"I want to try the breeze!"

"Then do this: breathe in slowly through your nose. Can you feel the air going in? Now blow out, nice and slow. Like a gentle wind."

Tommy tried. Nice and slow.

The air went in. The air went out. Soft and light.

And Tommy felt a bit like the wind. Free.

*Try it too! Breathe in slowly through your nose. Then blow out, soft and gentle. Like a light breeze. Do it three times.*

### Chapter 2 - The Tummy That Goes Up

One afternoon, Tommy lay down on the grass.

He watched the clouds. One looked like a bunny. Another one looked like ice cream.

"Put your hands on your tummy," said Mummy.

"Why?"

"You'll see."

Tommy put his hands on his tummy. And he felt something funny.

His tummy went up. And down. Up. And down.

Like a wave in the sea.

"Is my breath doing that?" he asked, amazed.

"Yes. Every time you breathe, your tummy fills with air. Like a balloon. And then it empties. Like a balloon slowly letting go."

Tommy laughed. "I'm a balloon!"

"A very beautiful balloon," said Mummy.

And they stayed there, on the grass, watching the clouds and feeling their tummies go up and down. Up and down. Up and down.

Like a wave.

*Try it too! Lie down and put your hands on your tummy. Can you feel it go up when you breathe in? And down when you breathe out? Your balloon goes up... and down. Nice and slow.*

### Chapter 3 - The Counting Breath

That night, Tommy could not fall asleep.

He was thinking too much. About school. About homework. About the neighbour's dog that always barked.

"Mummy, I'm not sleepy."

Mummy sat on his bed. "Shall I teach you a trick?"

"Yes!"

"Close your eyes. And count with me. Breathe in: one, two, three. Breathe out: one, two, three."

Tommy closed his eyes.

Breathe in. One. Two. Three.
Breathe out. One. Two. Three.

"Again," said Mummy, softly.

Breathe in. One. Two. Three.
Breathe out. One. Two. Three.

The fifth time, Tommy yawned.

The tenth time, he was already asleep.

Mummy kissed his forehead. "Goodnight, little champion."

*Try it too! Close your eyes. Breathe in, counting to three. Then breathe out, counting to three. You can use your fingers to count! Do it five times. How do you feel?*

### Chapter 4 - The Butterfly Breath

At the park, Tommy chased everything. Pigeons. Leaves. Soap bubbles.

Then he stopped.

A butterfly had landed on his hand.

It was small. Blue. Beautiful.

Tommy held his breath.

"If I breathe too hard, it will fly away," he thought.

So he breathed softly. Very, very softly.

Like a tiny little puff.

The butterfly stayed. Its wings moved just a little. Up and down. Slowly.

Tommy understood something: the butterfly was breathing too. In its own way. Small and gentle.

They stayed like that for a moment. Tommy and the butterfly. Still. Together.

Then the butterfly flew away.

And Tommy smiled. Because he had learned that sometimes, to keep beautiful things close, you have to be very gentle.

*Try it too! Open your hand, as if a butterfly is sitting on it. Breathe very softly, so gently that the butterfly doesn't fly away. Can you feel how calm you become?*

### Chapter 5 - The Breath That Warms

It was winter.

Tommy was walking with Daddy. The snow crunched under their boots. The air was very, very cold.

"Daddy, my hands are freezing!"

Daddy stopped. "Do this."

He cupped his hands in front of his mouth. And he blew.

HAAAA.

"Feel that? Your breath is warm."

Tommy tried. He cupped his hands in front of his mouth. And he blew.

HAAAA.

It was true! The air coming out was warm!

"My breath warms my hands," said Tommy.

"And you know what?" said Daddy. "It warms your heart too."

"How?"

"When you feel sad, or scared, try putting your hands here." Daddy put them on his chest. "And breathe slowly. The warmth goes inside too."

Tommy tried. Hands on his chest. Warm breath.

And he felt something. Like a hug. But from the inside.

*Try it too! Cup your hands in front of your mouth and blow gently. Feel the warmth? Now put your hands on your chest and breathe. Your breath warms everything, even on the inside.*

### Chapter 6 - The Five Senses Game

One afternoon it was raining. Tommy was bored.

"There's nothing to do!" he huffed.

Grandma smiled. "Want to play a game?"

"What game?"

"It's called the five senses game. Sit down and close your eyes."

Tommy sat down. He closed his eyes.

"What can you hear?" asked Grandma.

Tommy listened. "The rain. A little bird. The tick-tock of the clock."

"Very good. Now open your eyes. Tell me five things you can see."

"The red cup. The cat. The window. Your slippers. The rain."

"Now touch something. What does it feel like?"

Tommy touched the cushion. "Soft. Warm."

"Now sniff. What can you smell?"

"Biscuits!" shouted Tommy. "You made biscuits!"

Grandma laughed. "And that's the fifth sense. Have a taste."

Tommy ate a biscuit. Warm. Yummy.

And he wasn't bored anymore. Because when you use all your senses, the world becomes full of wonderful things.

*Try it too! Stop for a moment. Close your eyes and listen. Then open them and look all around you. Touch something. Sniff the air. How many lovely things were there, that you hadn't noticed?*

### Chapter 7 - The Bedtime Breath

Every night, before falling asleep, Tommy had his little ritual.

He got into his bed. He pulled the blanket up to his chin.

And he looked out of the window.

The moon was there. Yellow and round. And the stars were shining.

"Good evening, moon," he whispered.

Then he closed his eyes. And he began.

A long breath. In. Out.

He imagined he was a cloud. Light as a feather. Floating across the sky. Nice and slow.

In. Out.

His body got heavy. His legs, his arms, his head.

Everything became soft.

In. Out.

And his thoughts drifted away. Like little birds flying towards the moon.

Tomorrow would be another lovely day.

But now, it was time to sleep.

In. Out.

Goodnight, Tommy.

*Try it too! Tonight, in your bed, breathe slowly. Imagine you are a light, fluffy cloud. With each breath, you become softer. Calmer. In. Out. Goodnight.*

### Chapter 8 - The Breath We Share

It was Sunday.

The whole family was at home. Mummy, Daddy, Grandma, and Puffo the cat.

"Let's play a game," said Tommy. "I'll teach you."

Mummy and Daddy looked at each other, surprised.

"Sit in a circle. And hold hands."

They all sat on the floor, in a circle.

"Close your eyes."

They closed them.

"Now breathe with me. Slowly."

In. Out.

In. Out.

Bit by bit, their breaths joined together. Like music. All together. The same rhythm.

Mummy held Tommy's hand. Daddy held Grandma's hand. Puffo the cat purred in the middle of the circle.

Nobody spoke. But they all felt the same thing.

Peace.

When they opened their eyes, Tommy smiled. "Did you feel that? Breathing is even more beautiful when we do it together."

*Try it too! Ask your family to sit in a circle. Hold hands. Close your eyes. Breathe together, nice and slow. Can you feel how the breaths become one?*

### Chapter 9 - Your Magic Breath

Hello.

It's me, Tommy. And I want to tell you something.

Do you know what the greatest magic of breathing is?

It is always with you.

When you are happy, your breath is there.
When you are sad, your breath is there.
When you are scared, your breath is there.
When you are angry, your breath is there.

You don't have to buy it.
You don't have to look for it.
You can never lose it.

It is yours. Forever.

When the day is hard, stop. Breathe.
When everything goes too fast, stop. Breathe.
When you don't know what to do, stop. Breathe.

Your breath is your most faithful friend.

And now that you know the secret, you can use it whenever you want. At the park, at school, in your bed, anywhere.

Your magic breath.

Take a big breath, right now.

There. Did you feel it?

That is the magic.

*One last exercise: put your hand on your heart. Can you feel it beating? Now take a big breath. And say to yourself: "I am okay. My breath is with me." Well done. You were brilliant.*
