            <p>Let it not be in any man's power to say truly of thee, that thou art not simple, or that thou art not good; but let him be a liar, whosoever shall think anything of these things concerning thee.</p>
            <p>Labour not as one that is wretched, nor as one that would be pitied, or admired; but direct thy will and thy desire to one thing only: to be active or to rest, as the public good shall require.</p>
