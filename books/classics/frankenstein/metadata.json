  "amazon_description": "Discover the timeless masterpiece that launched science fiction and continues to haunt readers two centuries later. Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN tells the unforgettable story of Victor Frankenstein, a brilliant scientist who dares to create life itself—only to abandon his creation and unleash a tragedy that will consume everyone he loves.\n\nThis isn't the monster movie you think you know. Shelley's original novel is a profound meditation on ambition, responsibility, and what it means to be human. The Creature—eloquent, lonely, desperately seeking love—is one of literature's most sympathetic outcasts. His creator's rejection transforms him into a figure of Gothic tragedy, not horror.\n\nWritten when Shelley was just nineteen, FRANKENSTEIN remains shockingly relevant: a warning about scientific hubris, the ethics of creation, and the devastating consequences of abandoning those we bring into being.\n\nThis premium illustrated edition features:\n- Complete, unabridged 1818 text\n- Elegant European watercolor illustrations\n- Premium paper and binding\n- Perfect for collectors, students, and first-time readers\n\nTwo hundred years later, the question still echoes: Who is the real monster?",
