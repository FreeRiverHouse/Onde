The column is rendered in weathered white marble with golden light illuminating one edge. Dust particles floating in a single beam of light. Empty space for typography. Elegant, austere, contemplative mood. Clean composition, negative space emphasis. Professional book cover, high resolution.
```

### Prompt 3 - The Laurel Crown
```
Sophisticated book cover showing a golden laurel wreath crown resting on aged parchment or marble surface. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting from the left. Deep burgundy or navy blue background fading to black. The laurel leaves have subtle gold metallic texture. Minimalist composition with generous negative space.

## Notes for Designer

1. The cover must appeal to adult readers seeking serious philosophical content
2. Avoid any elements that might seem "mass market" or cheap
3. The design should suggest quality, depth, and timelessness
4. Gold accents should be subtle and sophisticated, not gaudy
5. The cover should work equally well as thumbnail and full-size
6. Consider how title "MEDITATIONS" and author "MARCUS AURELIUS" will integrate
7. A subtle tagline space may be needed for "The Private Thoughts of a Roman Emperor" or similar
