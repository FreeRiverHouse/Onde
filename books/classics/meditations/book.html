<section class="introduction" style="font-style: italic;">
    <h2>Editor's Note</h2>

    <p><em>Meditations</em> is one of the masterpieces of Stoic philosophy and perhaps the most personal document ever written by a Roman Emperor. Composed during military campaigns in the final years of Marcus Aurelius's life, these private reflections were never intended for publication.</p>

    <p>This edition is based on the translation by George Long, first published in 1862 and now in the public domain via Project Gutenberg. The text has been faithfully preserved without alteration.</p>

    <p>The illustrations in this volume were created especially for Onde Classics.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was born on April 26, A.D. 121. His real name was M. Annius Verus, and he was sprung of a noble family which claimed descent from Numa, second King of Rome. Thus the most religious of emperors came of the blood of the most pious of early kings.</p>

    <p>His father, Annius Verus, had held high office in Rome, and his grandfather, of the same name, had been thrice Consul. Both his parents died young, but Marcus held them in loving remembrance. On his father's death Marcus was adopted by his grandfather, the consular Annius Verus, and there was deep love between these two. On the very first page of his book Marcus gratefully declares how of his grandfather he had learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion.</p>

    <p>The Emperor Hadrian divined the fine character of the lad, whom he used to call not Verus but Verissimus, more Truthful than his own name. He advanced Marcus to equestrian rank when six years of age, and at the age of eight made him a member of the ancient Salian priesthood.</p>

    <p>His education was conducted with all care. The ablest teachers were engaged for him, and he was trained in the strict doctrine of the Stoic philosophy, which was his great delight. He was taught to dress plainly and to live simply, to avoid all softness and luxury. His body was trained to hardihood by wrestling, hunting, and outdoor games; and though his constitution was weak, he showed great personal courage to encounter the fiercest boars.</p>

    <p>Antoninus Pius died in 161, and Marcus assumed the imperial state. No sooner was Marcus settled upon the throne than wars broke out on all sides. The good emperor was not spared domestic troubles. But although Marcus Aurelius may have held intellectually that his soul was destined to be absorbed, and to lose consciousness of itself, there were times when he felt, as all who hold it must sometimes feel, how unsatisfying is such a creed.</p>

    <p>These Meditations record the innermost thoughts of his heart, set down to ease it, with such moral maxims and reflections as may help him to bear the burden of duty and the countless annoyances of a busy life. In their intimacy and frankness lies their great charm. These notes are not sermons; they are not even confessions. Marcus Aurelius is neither vulgar nor unctuous; he extenuates nothing, but nothing sets down in malice. He never poses before an audience; he may not be profound, but he is always sincere.</p>

<section id="book1" class="book">
    <h2>The First Book</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">I.</span> Of my grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion. From the fame and memory of him that begot me I have learned both shamefastness and manlike behaviour. Of my mother I have learned to be religious, and bountiful; and to forbear, not only to do, but to intend any evil; to content myself with a spare diet, and to fly all such excess as is incidental to great wealth. Of my great-grandfather, both to frequent public schools and auditories, and to get me good and able teachers at home; and that I ought not to think much, if upon such occasions, I were at excessive charges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">II.</span> Of him that brought me up, not to be fondly addicted to either of the two great factions of the coursers in the circus, called Prasini, and Veneti: nor in the amphitheatre partially to favour any of the gladiators, or fencers. Moreover, to endure labour; nor to need many things; when I have anything to do, to do it myself rather than by others; not to meddle with many businesses; and not easily to admit of any slander.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">III.</span> Of Diognetus, not to busy myself about vain things, and not easily to believe those things, which are commonly spoken, by such as take upon them to work wonders, and by sorcerers, or prestidigitators, and impostors; concerning the power of charms, and their driving out of demons, or evil spirits; and the like. Not to keep quails for the game; nor to be mad after such things. Not to be offended with other men's liberty of speech, and to apply myself unto philosophy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">IV.</span> To Rusticus I am beholding, that I first entered into the conceit that my life wanted some redress and cure. And then, that I did not fall into the ambition of ordinary sophists, either to write tracts concerning the common theorems, or to exhort men unto virtue and the study of philosophy by public orations. To read with diligence; not to rest satisfied with a light and superficial knowledge, nor quickly to assent to things commonly spoken of.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">V.</span> From Apollonius, true liberty, and unvariable steadfastness, and not to regard anything at all, though never so little, but right and reason: and always, whether in the sharpest pains, or after the loss of a child, or in long diseases, to be still the same man.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">VI.</span> Of Sextus, mildness and the pattern of a family governed with paternal affection; and a purpose to live according to nature: to be grave without affectation: to observe carefully the several dispositions of my friends, not to be offended with idiots.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">VII.</span> From Alexander the Grammarian, to be un-reprovable myself, and not reproachfully to reprehend any man for a barbarism, or a solecism, or any false pronunciation, but dextrously by way of answer, or testimony, or confirmation of the same matter to utter it as it should have been spoken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">VIII.</span> Of Fronto, to how much envy and fraud and hypocrisy the state of a tyrannous king is subject unto, and how they who are commonly called nobly born, are in some sort incapable, or void of natural affection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">IX.</span> Of Alexander the Platonic, not often nor without great necessity to say, or to write to any man in a letter, 'I am not at leisure'; nor in this manner still to put off those duties, which we owe to our friends and acquaintances under pretense of urgent affairs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">X.</span> Of Catulus, not to contemn any friend's expostulation, though unjust, but to strive to reduce him to his former disposition: freely and heartily to speak well of all my masters upon any occasion; and to love my children with true affection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XI.</span> From my brother Severus, to be kind and loving to all them of my house and family; by whom also I came to the knowledge of Thrasea and Helvidius, and Cato, and Dio, and Brutus. He it was also that did put me in the first conceit and desire of an equal commonwealth, administered by justice and equality; and of a kingdom wherein should be regarded nothing more than the good and welfare of the subjects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XII.</span> From Claudius Maximus, in all things to endeavour to have power of myself, and in nothing to be carried about; to be cheerful and courageous in all sudden chances and accidents, as in sicknesses: to love mildness, and moderation, and gravity: and to do my business, whatsoever it be, thoroughly, and without querulousness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XIII.</span> In my father, I observed his meekness; his constancy without wavering in those things, which after a due examination and deliberation, he had determined. How free from all vanity he carried himself in matter of honour and dignity. His laboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had aught to say tending to any common good.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XIV.</span> From the gods I received that I had good grandfathers, and parents, a good sister, good masters, good domestics, loving kinsmen, almost all that I have. That I never through haste and rashness transgressed against any of them. That I preserved the flower of my youth. That I took not upon me to be a man before my time, but rather put it off longer than I needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XV.</span> In the country of the Quadi at Granua, these. Betimes in the morning say to thyself, This day I shall have to do with an idle curious man, with an unthankful man, a railer, a crafty, false, or an envious man; an unsociable uncharitable man. All these ill qualities have happened unto them, through ignorance of that which is truly good and truly bad.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XVI.</span> Whatsoever I am, is either flesh, or life, or that which we commonly call the mistress and overruling part of man; reason. Away with thy books, suffer not thy mind any more to be distracted, and carried to and fro; for it will not be.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XVII.</span> Whatsoever proceeds from the gods immediately, that any man will grant totally depends from their divine providence. As for those things that are commonly said to happen by fortune, even those must be conceived to have dependence from nature, or from that first and general connection of all those things, which more apparently by the divine providence are administered and brought to pass.</p>
    </div>

<!-- BOOK II -->
<section id="book2" class="book">
    <h2>The Second Book</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">I.</span> Remember how long thou hast already put off these things, and how often a certain day and hour as it were, having been set unto thee by the gods, thou hast neglected it. It is high time for thee to understand the true nature both of the world, whereof thou art a part; and of that Lord and Governor of the world, from whom, as a channel from the spring, thou thyself didst flow: and that there is but a certain limit of time appointed unto thee, which if thou shalt not make use of to calm and allay the many distempers of thy soul, it will pass away and thou with it, and never after return.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">II.</span> Let it be thy earnest and incessant care as a Roman and a man to perform whatsoever it is that thou art about, with true and unfeigned gravity, natural affection, freedom and justice: and as for all other cares, and imaginations, how thou mayest ease thy mind of them. Which thou shalt do; if thou shalt go about every action as thy last action.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">III.</span> Do, soul, do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time for thee to respect thyself, will be at an end. Every man's happiness depends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles affording thyself no respect, thou dost make thy happiness to consist in the souls, and conceits of other men.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">IV.</span> Why should any of these things that happen externally, so much distract thee? Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing, and cease roving and wandering to and fro.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">V.</span> For not observing the state of another man's soul, scarce was ever any man known to be unhappy. Tell whosoever they be that intend not, and guide not by reason and discretion the motions of their own souls, they must of necessity be unhappy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">VI.</span> These things thou must always have in mind: What is the nature of the universe, and what is mine--in particular: This unto that what relation it hath: what kind of part, of what kind of universe it is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">VII.</span> Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin says well and like a philosopher, that those sins are greater which are committed through lust, than those which are committed through anger.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">VIII.</span> Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do, and so project all, as one who, for aught thou knowest, may at this very present depart out of this life. And as for death, if there be any gods, it is no grievous thing to leave the society of men.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">IX.</span> Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the bodies and substances themselves, into the matter and substance of the world: and their memories into the general age and time of the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">X.</span> It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to consider what they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits and voices, honour and credit do proceed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XI.</span> Consider with thyself how man, and by what part of his, is joined unto God, and how that part of man is affected, when it is said to be diffused.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XII.</span> If thou shouldst live three thousand, or as many as ten thousands of years, yet remember this, that man can part with no life properly, save with that little part of life, which he now lives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XIII.</span> Remember that all is but opinion and conceit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XIV.</span> A man's soul doth wrong and disrespect itself first and especially, when as much as in itself lies it becomes an aposteme, and as it were an excrescency of the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XV.</span> The time of a man's life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption. His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame doubtful; to be brief, as a stream so are all things belonging to the body; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto the soul. Our life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no better than oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? Only one thing, philosophy.</p>

Thou must hasten therefore; not only because thou art every day nearer unto death than other, but also because that intellective faculty in thee, whereby thou art enabled to know the true nature of things, and to order all thy actions by that knowledge, doth daily waste and decay.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XIV.</span> As physicians and chirurgeons have always their instruments ready at hand for all sudden cures; so have thou always thy dogmata in a readiness for the knowledge of things, both divine and human.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="section-number">XV.</span> Be not deceived; for thou shalt never live to read thy moral commentaries, nor the acts of the famous Romans and Grecians.

        <p><span class="section-number">XXVII.</span> O man! as a citizen thou hast lived, and conversed in this great city the world. Whether just for so many years, or no, what is it unto thee? Thou hast lived as long as the laws and orders of the city required. Why then should it be grievous unto thee, if the same nature that brought thee in, doth now send thee out of the world? As if the praetor should fairly dismiss him from the stage, whom he had taken in to act a while. Oh, but the play is not yet at an end, there are but three acts yet acted of it? Thou hast well said: for in matter of life, three acts is the whole play. Now to set a certain time to every man's acting, belongs unto him only, who as first he was of thy composition, so is now the cause of thy dissolution. As for thyself; thou hast to do with neither. Go thy ways then well pleased and contented: for so is He that dismisseth thee.</p>
