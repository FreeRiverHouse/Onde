# Portal Sound Effects

This folder contains sound effects for the portal system.

## Required Files

- `portal-whoosh.mp3` - The main portal travel sound effect
  - Duration: ~1-2 seconds
  - Style: Magical whoosh/swoosh sound with slight reverb
  - Can be generated with tools like:
    - [sfxr](https://sfxr.me/)
    - [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/)
    - Or use royalty-free sounds from freesound.org

## Fallback Behavior

If the sound file is missing, the portal will work silently.
The component gracefully handles missing audio files.
