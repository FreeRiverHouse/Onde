## Competitive Positioning

### vs Palo Alto (Prisma)
- **Their claim**: Best-of-breed security
- **Reality**: Bolt-on architecture, separate management planes for SD-WAN and SASE
- **Our advantage**: Single-pass architecture, unified policy engine, lower latency
- **Question to plant**: "How do they handle policy consistency across SD-WAN and cloud security?"

### vs Zscaler
- **Their claim**: Cloud-native security
- **Reality**: No native SD-WAN, depends on partners
- **Our advantage**: True SASE with integrated SD-WAN, can work with or without internet
- **Question to plant**: "What happens when you need local breakout or direct cloud connect?"

### vs Cato Networks
- **Their claim**: Simple SASE
- **Reality**: Limited SD-WAN capabilities, weak on-prem security
- **Our advantage**: Enterprise-grade SD-WAN, full NGF/NGAV/ZTNA on-prem
- **Question to plant**: "How do they handle branch-to-branch traffic without hairpinning?"

### vs Fortinet
- **Their claim**: Integrated security fabric
- **Reality**: Hardware-centric, complex management
- **Our advantage**: Cloud-native, single software stack, easier to scale
- **Question to plant**: "What's involved in upgrading firmware across all locations?"
