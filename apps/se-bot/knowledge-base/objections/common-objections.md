# Common Objections Handling

## Pricing / Budget

### "It's too expensive"
**Response Framework:**
1. Acknowledge the concern
2. Reframe as investment vs cost
3. Show TCO comparison (MPLS savings, appliance consolidation)
4. Highlight hidden costs of alternatives (integration, multi-vendor support)

**Example:**
> "I understand budget is a concern. Let's look at the full picture - what are you spending today on MPLS circuits, branch firewalls, VPN infrastructure, and management overhead? Most customers see 40-60% savings on circuits alone, plus operational efficiency..."

### "We can't justify the investment right now"
**Response Framework:**
1. Explore timeline and priorities
2. Identify quick wins that show value
3. Offer phased approach
4. Quantify cost of doing nothing

## Competition

### "We're evaluating [Competitor]"
**Response Framework:**
1. Respect their evaluation process
2. Ask what criteria matter most
3. Position differentiators relevant to THEIR priorities
4. Offer comparison framework (not FUD)

**Key Questions:**
- "What's most important in your decision?"
- "What problems are you trying to solve first?"
- "How are you weighting integration vs best-of-breed?"

### "[Competitor] says you can't do X"
**Response Framework:**
1. Don't get defensive
2. Ask for specifics
3. Demonstrate capability (live if possible)
4. Explain where claim might have originated (old info, specific scenario)

## Technical Concerns

### "We need on-premises, not cloud"
**Response:**
> "We support both. Some customers want full cloud, some want on-prem, most want hybrid. What's driving your on-prem requirement? Compliance? Data sovereignty? Latency? Let's talk about your specific constraints..."

### "How do you handle [specific protocol/app]?"
**Response Framework:**
1. Confirm understanding of requirement
2. Explain how it's handled (DPI, policy, optimization)
3. Offer to demonstrate in POC
4. Reference similar customer scenarios

### "What about integration with [tool]?"
**Response Framework:**
1. Check integration directory
2. If native: explain how it works
3. If API: explain customization options
4. If not available: discuss roadmap or workarounds

## Organizational

### "We just deployed [something else]"
**Response:**
> "I understand - no one wants to rip and replace something new. A few questions: How's it going? Are you seeing the value you expected? Is there anything it doesn't cover well? Many customers start with us for specific use cases while keeping existing investments..."

### "Our team doesn't have bandwidth"
**Response Framework:**
1. Acknowledge resource constraints
2. Highlight simplicity and automation (ZTP, templates)
3. Offer professional services / managed options
4. Show operational efficiency gains

### "We need to involve more stakeholders"
**Response:**
> "Absolutely - who else should be in the conversation? What are their priorities? I'm happy to do a technical deep-dive for the network team, a security review for the security team, and a business case discussion for leadership. What makes sense?"

## Stalling

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:**
> "Of course. To help you think it through - what are the main considerations? Is it budget, timing, technical fit, or something else? What would help you get clarity on those?"

### "We'll get back to you"
**Response:**
> "Sounds good. What's a reasonable timeline? And what would be most helpful for me to provide in the meantime - technical documentation, customer references, pricing options?"

### "We're not ready yet"
**Response:**
> "Understood. When do you anticipate being ready? Is there anything changing in your environment that would drive that timeline - contract renewals, new projects, compliance requirements?"
