      <div class="post-content">Around 170 AD, a Roman emperor sat alone in his tent after a long day of battle. By candlelight, he wrote in his private journal:

"The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."

Marcus Aurelius never intended for anyone to read these words. They were reminders to himself, on the hardest days.

Two thousand years later, they still find the people who need them.</div>

What he wanted was to be a better person.

"Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."

He wrote this for himself, not for us. But sometimes the most private words become the most universal.</div>

"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive — to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love."

Maybe that's when gratitude matters most — not when things are easy, but when they're hard.</div>

Wealth didn't blind him to the truth. Time is the only thing we can never get back.

"Life is long, if you know how to use it."

"Some things are within our power, while others are not."

Simple idea. Revolutionary practice.

You can't control the weather. You can control how you dress.
You can't control others' opinions. You can control your actions.
You can't control the past. You can control what you do next.

      <div class="post-content">This morning I spent two hours choosing a font for a children's poetry book.

It might seem like a small thing. But fonts speak before words do.

A rounded font says "this is playful." A serif font says "this is serious."

For a children's book, you need something in between — something that says "this matters, but it's also fun."

The invisible choices are often the most important ones.</div>

      <div class="post-content">Today at the publishing house: reading a nursery rhyme out loud for the fifth time.

Not because there are mistakes. But because rhythm matters.

When a child reads aloud, every syllable counts. Every pause. Every breath.

A good children's poem isn't just read — it's felt. It becomes a song in the mouth.

That's what we're looking for. That moment when words become music.</div>

The challenge: some Italian words have no English equivalent. Some feelings exist in one language but not another.

The solution isn't to find the perfect word. It's to find the perfect feeling.

The challenge: how do you talk about technology without losing the magic?

A robot can be a friend. Science can be poetry. The future can be exciting instead of scary.

The beginning of any book is the hardest part. Not because it's difficult to write — but because it makes a promise.

It seemed simple when I started. "Should take an hour," I thought.

Narrator: It did not take an hour.

The lesson: simple in theory is often complex in practice.

The code doesn't care about your estimates.</div>

When you write code at 2 AM, it always seems brilliant.

In the light of day? Less so.

The best programmers aren't the ones who never write bad code. They're the ones willing to admit it and fix it.</div>

It's not glamorous. It's not exciting. No one throws a party for "didn't break for a while."

The bot worked perfectly with fake data. Beautiful. Flawless.

In production? It discovered that real-world data is weird. Messy. Unpredictable.

The simulation is never the real thing. The map is never the territory.

Always test with reality.</div>

90% of the time is spent figuring out why something doesn't work.

An imperfect system that runs is better than a perfect system on paper.

Sometimes the best solution is subtraction, not addition. Removing complexity instead of adding it.

The reason: a test I wrote 6 months ago, incorrectly.
