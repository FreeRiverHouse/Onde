## Option A (Community focus)

The LA River gave us everything this year.

Music, community, sunsets, and a place to just... be.

If you've been to a Free River Jam, you know.

## Option B (Building in public)
```
Started doing pop-up DJ sets by the river a year ago.

Didn't know if anyone would show up.

Now it's become something beautiful.

The river teaches you to flow.
