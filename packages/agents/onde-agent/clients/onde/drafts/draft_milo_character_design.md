## Post 1 - Technical (Challenge + Solution)
**Chars: 267**

```
Running PixArt Sigma on Apple Silicon M1 Pro.

The challenge: memory constraints breaking generation.

The fix: VAE on CPU with float32, guidance=6.0, 28 steps.

Local AI, real constraints, working solutions.

## Post 2 - Characters Intro
**Chars: 243**

```
Meet the cast of "MILO - AI Explained for Kids":

MILO - an orange penguin robot who learns alongside humans

Sofia, 7 - curious, asks the hard questions

Luca, 5 - finds wonder in everything

AI literacy starts with characters kids can relate to.

## Post 3 - Building in Public
**Chars: 256**

```
We're building a children's book about AI.

Every illustration generated locally. Every character designed through iteration. Every technical challenge documented.

No cloud APIs. No shortcuts.

Just CORDE, patience, and the belief that AI literacy matters.
