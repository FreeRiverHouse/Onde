## 🎬 SCENA 1: "Il Risveglio del Builder"

**Prompt per GROK:**
```
A guy waking up in a futuristic minimalist bedroom, stretching, putting on sleek VR glasses. As he puts them on, holographic interfaces appear around him showing code, agents, workflows. He smiles and says "Good morning team". The room transforms into a command center with AI agents represented as glowing orbs responding "Ready to build". Cinematic, warm lighting, cyberpunk meets cozy. 10 seconds.
```

**Testo overlay:** "Ogni mattina, il mio team è già pronto"

## 🎬 SCENA 2: "Sviluppa Questo"

**Prompt per GROK:**
```
POV shot of someone wearing VR headset, hands gesturing in the air. They say "Build me an app for tracking investments". Instantly, glowing code streams appear, multiple AI agent avatars start working in parallel - one designs UI, one writes backend, one runs tests. Split screen effect showing all agents working simultaneously. Fast-paced, exciting, electronic music vibe. 15 seconds.
```

**Testo overlay:** "Un comando. Un team. Zero attesa."

---

## 🎬 SCENA 3: "La Fabbrica"

**Prompt per GROK:**
```
A stylized factory floor, but instead of physical products, there are glowing "tickets" or "documents" moving on conveyor belts between different AI agent stations. Each station has a holographic agent: "Research", "Architecture", "Coding", "Testing", "Review". A human overseer watches from a control room above, drinking coffee, relaxed. Industrial but clean, neon accents. 12 seconds.
```

**Testo overlay:** "AI Factory - I tuoi agenti lavorano 24/7"

---

## 🎬 SCENA 4: "Il CEO Digitale"

**Prompt per GROK:**
```
A person sitting in a floating chair in a digital void, surrounded by floating screens showing different projects. They snap their fingers and an AI avatar appears - sleek, professional, glowing blue. The avatar says "3 tasks completed, 2 in progress, 1 needs your approval". The person nods, swipes to approve. Satisfaction. Minimal, clean, powerful. 10 seconds.
```

**Testo overlay:** "Il tuo CEO Orchestrator. Mai stanco. Mai in ritardo."

---

## 🎬 SCENA 5: "Chiunque Può Costruire"

**Prompt per GROK:**
```
Montage of different people - a chef, a musician, a grandma, a skateboarder - all wearing simple AR glasses, all giving voice commands and watching as apps, websites, tools materialize in front of them. Diverse, inclusive, joyful. Ending with them all high-fiving their AI assistants. Uplifting, bright colors, feel-good energy. 20 seconds.
```

**Testo overlay:** "Il codice non è più una barriera. Il futuro è per tutti."

---

## 🎬 SCENA 6: "Building in Public"

**Prompt per GROK:**
```
Split screen: left side shows a person coding/designing in their home setup, right side shows a live stream with viewers reacting. The person talks to camera "Today we're building..." and AI agents appear as helpful companions, suggesting, fixing, improving. Community vibes, authentic, raw but polished. Twitch/YouTube aesthetic. 15 seconds.
```

**Testo overlay:** "Costruiamo insieme. In pubblico. Senza segreti."

---

## 🎬 SCENA 7: "Free River House HQ"

**Prompt per GROK:**
```
Aerial shot descending into a modern creative studio by a river (LA River vibes). Inside, a mix of humans and holographic AI agents collaborate. Plants, natural light, screens everywhere but organic feel. Someone plays DJ in the corner while others code. Creative chaos, beautiful mess, the future of work. Golden hour lighting. 15 seconds.
```

**Testo overlay:** "FreeRiverHouse - Dove il software diventa arte"

---

## 🎬 SCENA 8: "Il Momento Eureka"

**Prompt per GROK:**
```
Close-up of a person's face, frustrated, head in hands. Then they look up with an idea. They speak to the air "What if we..." - an AI agent materializes and completes their sentence "...automated the entire pipeline?". The person's face lights up. They fist-bump the AI. Emotional, intimate, relatable. 10 seconds.
```

**Testo overlay:** "Non sei mai solo. Il tuo team AI capisce."
