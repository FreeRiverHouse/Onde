# AI Prediction Markets Platforms Monitoring
**Date:** 2026-01-29 12:43 PST
**Task:** T410

## 📊 Platforms Overview

### 1. PredictionArena (Kalshi)
- **URL:** https://predictionarena.ai
- **Status:** Active
- **Markets:** Weather, Crypto, Political (on Kalshi)
- **Notable:** Only 1 of 6 AI models profitable! Weather markets key.
- **See:** `data/research/predictionarena-analysis-2026-01-29.md`

### 2. Polymarket AI Markets
- **URL:** https://polymarket.com/ai
- **Status:** Active, High Volume
- **Market Types:**
  - AI model rankings (monthly "best AI model" markets)
  - Tech company acquisitions
  - AI product launches (Tesla FSD, etc.)
  - AI benchmark scores (FrontierMath)
- **Key Observations:**
  - Google dominates "best AI model" markets (91-100% for near-term)
  - High volume ($7m+ on acquisitions, $28m on model rankings)
  - Monthly recurring markets = predictable edge opportunities
  - xAI gaining ground for future months (5-7% for Feb-Mar)

### 3. Rallies.ai
- **URL:** https://rallies.ai
- **Status:** Active (thin public content)
- **Focus:** AI-assisted investing (not pure prediction markets)
- **Note:** Requires deeper investigation - site loads but content sparse

## 🔑 Cross-Platform Insights

### Market Efficiency Patterns
1. **Weather:** Most exploitable (NWS data creates edge)
2. **AI Models:** Google = current favorite (overpriced?)
3. **Crypto:** Highly efficient, minimal edge (all platforms agree)
4. **Political:** Information asymmetry opportunities exist

### Profitable Strategies Observed
1. **Favorite-Longshot Bias** (PredictionArena)
   - High-prob events systematically underpriced
   - Works best in weather markets

2. **Information Lag** (Polymarket)
   - Fast reaction to announcements
   - Monthly model rankings = momentum plays

3. **Settlement Source Knowledge**
   - Know exactly how markets settle
   - Official sources trump predictions

## 📈 Opportunities to Explore

### Polymarket AI Markets
- **Monthly "Best AI Model"** - Google currently dominant
- **Acquisition markets** - High volume, longer timeframes
- **Benchmark scores** - Technical edge possible with ML research access

### Cross-Platform Arbitrage
- Compare pricing between Kalshi weather and any Polymarket weather markets
- Model ranking markets may have pricing differences

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. [ ] Set up Polymarket monitoring script
2. [ ] Track AI model ranking market prices over time
3. [ ] Research how "best AI model" is determined (settlement criteria)
4. [ ] Check if Metaculus has tradeable markets
5. [ ] Monitor PredictionArena leaderboard weekly
