## 01:30 PST - Heartbeat Work

### T087 Completed: Multi-timeframe Momentum Integration
- **Problem**: Momentum tracking code existed but was NEVER USED in find_opportunities()
- **Solution**:
  1. `get_btc_ohlc()` now fetches 7-day OHLC (valid CoinGecko param)
  2. `run_cycle()` calculates momentum before scanning markets
  3. `find_opportunities()` now accepts momentum parameter
  4. Probabilities adjusted via `adjust_probability_with_momentum()`
  5. Skip trades that conflict with strong momentum trends
  6. 2% edge bonus for momentum-aligned trades
  7. Momentum logged with each trade for analysis
- **Fix**: CoinGecko OHLC only accepts specific days (1,7,14,30...), changed from days=2 to days=7

### New Tasks Added
- T232: Add momentum analysis to weekly trading report
- T233: Add Fear & Greed index to trade logs
- T234: Implement trailing stop-loss

### Autotrader Status
- Running: PID 2997
- Balance: $11.13 cash, $5.29 portfolio
- 7 open positions

## Heartbeat 17:00 PST

### Completed
- **T242**: Created `analyze-skip-patterns.py` to analyze kalshi-skips.jsonl
  - Found old 15%/25% thresholds too conservative
  - Current 10% threshold appropriate (most skips had <2% edge)
  - 65% of NO skips under old threshold had positive edge
  
- **T245**: Fixed "Bet too small" bug in autotrader
  - Was selecting 100¢ NO contracts (no profit potential)
  - Added filter for extreme prices (≤5¢ or ≥95¢)
  - Fixed skip logging to not double-count extreme price skips

### Autotrader Status
- Running on PID 3838
- Cash: $11.13 | Portfolio: $5.24
- 7 open positions
- Momentum: NEUTRAL (BTC -0.04, ETH -0.05)
- Waiting for opportunities with >10% edge
