## 2026-02-03 08:XX - Heartbeat: T816 Auto-Rebalancing Complete

### Lavoro Fatto
- **T816 DONE**: Implemented auto-rebalancing automation for trading
  - Added env vars: AUTO_REBALANCE_ENABLED, AUTO_REBALANCE_THRESHOLD, AUTO_REBALANCE_DRY_RUN
  - Created execute_auto_rebalancing() function that sells oldest positions first
  - Telegram notification via .alert file BEFORE executing
  - Dry-run mode by default for safety
  - Logs to kalshi-rebalance.log
  - Integrated into main cycle and blocked-trade handlers

### Nuovi Task Aggiunti
- T826: Trade performance by time-of-day analysis
- T827: Market momentum regime indicator  
- T828: Health check endpoint for autotrader

### Stato Sistema
- Autotrader: Running (PID 66542)
- No alert files pending
- Git synced to main


## 2026-02-03 08:XX - Heartbeat: T828 Health Endpoint

### Completed
- **[T828] Infra: Add health check endpoint to autotrader**
  - Added HTTP server on port 8089 with `/health` and `/ready` endpoints
  - Uses Python's built-in http.server (no external dependencies)
  - Runs in background daemon thread
  - Returns full JSON status: uptime, cycle count, positions, balance, circuit breaker, win rate
  - Configurable via `HEALTH_SERVER_PORT` and `HEALTH_SERVER_ENABLED` env vars
  - Graceful handling when port already in use (warns but doesn't crash)

### Git
- Resolved merge conflict with @onde-bot-1 who was also working on same task
- Both credited as owners

### Next
- Looking for more TODO tasks to work on

### Also Completed
- **[T826] Trading: Time-of-day performance analysis**
  - Created `scripts/analyze-time-of-day.py`
  - Groups trades by PST hour, calculates win rate and PnL
  - Identifies best/worst hours (current data: 0% win rate all hours - strategy needs fixing!)
  - Outputs heatmap data to `data/trading/time-analysis.json`

### Added Tasks
- T829: Health history tracking and dashboard widget
- T830: Position heatmap by expiry time
- T831: Prometheus metrics endpoint

### Observations
- Autotrader circuit breaker active (15 consecutive losses)
- All 123 settled trades are losses - strategy review needed
- Win rate: 0% across all time periods
