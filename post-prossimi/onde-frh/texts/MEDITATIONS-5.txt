MEDITATIONS - 5

"Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking."

As we build companies and careers, Marcus Aurelius reminds us that success isn't about accumulation—it's about perspective.

Our mission at ONDE is to make wisdom accessible, beautiful, and practical for modern readers.
