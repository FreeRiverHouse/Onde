MEDITATIONS - 1

"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive, to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love."

Marcus Aurelius wrote these words as personal reflections. Never meant to be read by anyone else. Just a man trying to stay human while the weight of an empire pressed down on him.
