MEDITATIONS - 9

"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

In uncertain times, Marcus Aurelius offers this timeless truth: focus on what you can control. Your mindset, your response, your choices.

We've created a beautiful edition of "Meditations" that brings ancient wisdom to modern challenges.
