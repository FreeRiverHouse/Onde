MEDITATIONS - 7

Marcus Aurelius was the most powerful man in the world. Yet every morning, he reminded himself: "When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive, to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love."

Our new edition of "Meditations" makes these timeless reflections accessible and beautiful for today's readers.
