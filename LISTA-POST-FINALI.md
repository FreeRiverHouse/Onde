The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures.

### 2. Morning Wisdom (stile approfondito)
"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive, to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love."
Marcus Aurelius wrote these words as personal reflections. Never meant to be read by anyone else. Just a man trying to stay human while the weight of an empire pressed down on him.

### 3. Obstacle as Path (stile approfondito)
"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."
This Stoic principle from Marcus Aurelius feels particularly relevant today. Every setback contains the seed of opportunity. Every constraint drives innovation.
